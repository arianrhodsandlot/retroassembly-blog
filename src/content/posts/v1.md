I'm excited to announce that RetroAssembly v1 has been released!

Compared to the initial release (let's just call it v0) last month, this release brings several highly requested features and improvements that enhance your retro gaming experience. Here are the key highlights:

- Docker self-hosting
- Dark mode
- Continue with the latest saved state
- Full screen mode
- MD5-based metadata matching

## Dive into the new features

### Docker self-hosting
<img width="auto" height="300" alt="self-host" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c745a9e-f06d-4eea-a222-3922d71692ed" />

Self-hosting has been the most requested feature since RetroAssembly was announced. We've now released an official Docker image for advanced users who want complete control over their gaming environment.

Quick Start:
```sh
docker run -d --name retroassembly -p 8000:8000 -v /path/to/your/data:/app/data arianrhodsandlot/retroassembly
```
Replace `/path/to/your/data` with your preferred data directory. This will store your game library, save states, and user data locally.

### Dark mode

Enjoy a sleek dark theme! Switch between light and dark modes to match your preference and reduce eye strain during those late-night gaming sessions.

### Continue with the latest saved state
<img width="auto" height="300" alt="continue" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0020a8cf-1d05-4ccf-afca-41384a31c078" />

A "Continue" button to quickly resume from the last position where you exited has been added.

### Full screen mode
<img width="auto" height="300" alt="fullscreen" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/938c7141-a9c8-47b5-a86f-0819eec8ba2d" />

Enable full screen mode to enjoy your games without any distractions. You can also enter full screen mode manually while running a game.

### MD5-based metadata matching
Game identification and metadata retrieval have been enhanced with MD5 hash matching rather than the old file name based matching.
