RetroAssembly v4 has been released!

This release brings several features and improvements. Here are the key highlights:

- Redesigned library home page
- Internationalization (i18n) support
- Sortable game lists
- Upgraded emulators

## Dive into the new features

### Redesigned library home page

In the past, the library home page displayed a full list of games, which could be overwhelming for large libraries. Now, the home page shows the most recently saved/played/added games, making it easier to discover and access your favorite titles.

### Internationalization (i18n) support

Bonjour! Hola! RetroAssembly now supports multiple languages, allowing users to switch between different languages for a more personalized experience.

### Sortable game lists

You can now sort your game lists by various criteria such as name, date released, and date added, making it easier to organize and find games in your library.

### Upgraded emulators

The bundled RetroArch has been upgraded to v1.22.2, bringing the latest improvements from the upstream projects.

The RetroArch files are also compressed with zip to reduce their size, which should significantly improve loading times, especially for large emulators like FBNeo (decreased from ~34MB to ~10MB).
