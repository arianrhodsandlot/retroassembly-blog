## Dive into the new features

### Multi-user support for self-hosted instances

RetroAssembly now supports multiple users on a single instance for self-hosted users! Create separate profiles for family members or friends, each with their own game libraries, saves, and preferences.

### Auto-saving functionality

Never lose your progress! Auto-saving automatically saves your game at intervals, ensuring you can always pick up where you left off.

It's disabled by default and can be enabled in the settings. You can have up to 20 auto-save slots per game.

Configure different shaders per platform for the optimal visual experience, allowing you to customize the look and feel of each console separately.
