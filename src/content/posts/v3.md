RetroAssembly v3 has been released!

This release brings several features and improvements. Here are the key highlights:

- Searching through the library
- Custom BIOSes
- FBNeo is added as the new default arcade emulator
- 10 new platforms: Atari 7800, PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16), Magnavox Odyssey 2, etc.

## Dive into the new features

### Searching through the library

A search bar is added to quick navigate to the game you are seeking for.

It can also be opened with a keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> - <kbd>K</kbd> for Windows/Linux, <kbd>⌘</kbd> - <kbd>K</kbd> for macOS.

### Custom BIOSes

Some emulators need BIOSes to work properly. Now we can upload the BIOSes through the settings dialog.

### FBNeo

FBNeo is added to support a wider range of arcade games, comparing to MAME 2003-Plus. MAME 2003-Plus is still there, but FBNeo now becomes the default emulator for the arcade platform.
